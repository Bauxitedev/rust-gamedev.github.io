Welcome to the 28th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [BENDYWORM]

![An animation of a platformer where the entire world bends around
you](bendyworm.gif) _Watch out! The entire world bends around you!_

BENDYWORM ([GitHub][BENDYWORM-github],
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bauxitedev/status/1466034866122891266), by
[@bauxitedev](https://twitter.com/bauxitedev)) is a platformer with a twist:
the entire world bends and twists around you as your progress through the
level. Why? Because you're inside of a gigantic worm, and worms are bendy.

The game was made for GitHub Game Off 2021, and uses `godot-rust` behind the
scenes.

The game is available for free on [itch.io][BENDYWORM-itch.io], and the source
code is available on [GitHub][BENDYWORM-github].  (Windows only for now, Linux
build available soon)
